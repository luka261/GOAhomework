<h1>animation</h1>


<h2> Long before modern animation began, audiences around the world were captivated by the magic of moving characters.
For centuries,
master artists and craftsmen have brought puppets, automatons, shadow puppets, and fantastical lanterns to life,
inspiring the imagination through physically manipulated wonders.
In 1833, the stroboscopic disc (better known as the phenakistiscope) introduced the principle of modern animation,
which would also be applied in the zoetrope (introduced in 1866), the flip book (1868), the praxinoscope (1877) and

film. </h2>

<h3>the worlds first airplane</h3>

<h4>The Wright Flyer (also known as the Kitty Hawk, Flyer I or the 1903 Flyer) 
made the first sustained flight by a manned heavier-than-air powered and controlled aircraft—an airplane—on December 17, 1903.
Invented and flown by brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright, it marked the beginning of the pioneer era of aviation.</h4>

<h5>Crude ideas and designs of automobiles can be traced back to ancient and medieval times.
In 1649, Hans Hautsch of Nuremberg built a clockwork-driven carriage. In 1672, a small-scale steam-powered vehicle was created;
first steam-powered automobile capable of human transportation was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1769. 
Inventors began to branch out at the start of the 19th century, 
creating the de Rivaz engine, one of the first internal combustion engines, and an early electric motor.
Samuel Brown later tested the first industrially applied internal combustion engine in 1826. Only two of these were made.</h5>
